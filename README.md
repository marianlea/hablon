# Hablon

Hi! I’m Lea, and Hablon is a personal passion project I’m building to support Filipino artisans, farmers, and small producers by giving them a platform to showcase and sell their handmade and locally sourced products directly to consumers.

## 🎯 Why Hablon?

Many of the vendors I want to empower rely primarily on mobile phones and often have limited data connections. Because of this, I’m designing Hablon with a **mobile-first, low-bandwidth approach** to ensure the app is fast, accessible, and easy to use even in areas with unstable or slow internet.

My goal is to help these communities preserve traditional crafts, build sustainable livelihoods, and reach customers without relying on middlemen.

## 🛠️ Features (In Progress)

- Vendor sign-up and onboarding with a simple, intuitive flow
- Product listing management for vendors
- Responsive, mobile-first design built with Tailwind CSS
- Conditional product visibility — only vendors with listed products are searchable
- Splash screen loader for smoother data fetching
- Backend development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) underway

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js (planned)
- **Database:** MongoDB (planned)
